# **League Rules & Handicap Bylaws**

---

## **1\. Purpose**

The league handicap and scoring system ensures fair and competitive play between golfers of all skill levels. A player’s handicap reflects their capability—their potential when playing well—rather than their average performance.

---

## **2\. Key Definitions**

* Score Differential: A standardized measure of performance relative to course difficulty, calculated as:

   \\text{Differential} \= \\frac{(\\text{Adjusted Gross Score} \- \\text{Course Rating}) \\times 113}{\\text{Slope Rating}}

* Adjusted Gross Score (AGS): The player’s gross score after applying net double bogey adjustments for handicap calculation purposes only.

  * For established players: Net Double Bogey \= Par \+ 2 \+ strokes received on that hole.

  * For new players: Par \+ 5 is used until a league handicap is established.

* League Handicap: The base handicap calculated from the last five rounds of league play.

* Course Handicap: The number of strokes a player receives on a given course, adjusted for Course Rating and Slope Rating.

* Playing Handicap: The course handicap multiplied by the 95% allowance, rounded to the nearest whole number. This determines strokes received in league matches.

---

## **3\. Handicap Calculation**

### **3.1 Established Players (5 or More Rounds)**

* Use the last five (5) recorded nine-hole rounds.

* Drop the two highest (worst) differentials.

* Average the remaining three (3) lowest (best) differentials.

* Round to the nearest 0.1 stroke.

Example:

Differentials: 10.5, 12.0, 14.0, 15.5, 18.0

→ Drop 15.5 and 18.0

→ Average (10.5 \+ 12.0 \+ 14.0) ÷ 3 \= 12.2

→ League Handicap \= 12.2

---

### **3.2 New Players (Provisional Handicaps) and start of season**

All new players will receive a provisional handicap assigned by the committee based on their prior known ability or estimated average score. At the start of a season, the provisional handicap will be the previous season's handicap, for returning players.

| Rounds Played | Method | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0 rounds | Committee-assigned provisional handicap | Based on prior known ability or estimated average score |
| 1 round | ((2 * Committee-assigned provisional handicap) + differential from round 1) / 3 | Weighted average of provisional handicap and first round differential |
| 2 rounds | ((Committee-assigned provisional handicap) + (differential from round 1) + (differential from round 2)) / 3 | Average of provisional handicap and first two rounds differentials |
| 3–4 rounds | Average of all differentials (no drops) | Converts to full league handicap after 5 rounds |

---

## **4\. Course Handicap & Playing Handicap**

### **4.1 Course Handicap Formula**

All players will use the same tees, but Course Rating and Slope Rating are included for accuracy:

\\text{Course Handicap} \= \\left( \\frac{\\text{League Handicap} \\times \\text{Slope Rating}}{113} \\right) \+ (\\text{Course Rating} \- \\text{Par})

Round to the nearest tenth (0.1).

### **4.2 Playing Handicap Formula**

\\text{Playing Handicap} \= \\text{Course Handicap} \\times 0.95

Round to the nearest whole number.

Example:

* League Handicap: 12.2

* Course Rating: 36.1

* Par: 36

* Slope Rating: 120

   \\text{Course Handicap} \= \\left( \\frac{12.2 \\times 120}{113} \\right) \+ (36.1 \- 36\) \= 13.95

   \\text{Playing Handicap} \= 13.95 \\times 0.95 \= 13.25 \\rightarrow 13

---

## **5\. Match Play Strokes**

In each 1v1 matchup, the difference between the two players’ Playing Handicaps determines how many strokes the higher-handicap player receives.

* Only one player receives strokes.

* Strokes are applied starting with the \#1 handicap hole on the scorecard, continuing to \#2, \#3, etc., until all strokes are used.

---

## **6\. Scoring System**

Each 9-hole match is worth 22 total points:

| Component | Points | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Hole-by-hole | 18 pts | 2 points per hole to the player with the better net score (1 each if tied). |
| Overall | 4 pts | Awarded to the player with the lower total net score over 9 holes (split if tied). |

*   
  All strokes must be counted — no maximum strokes per hole.

* Net score \= gross score – applicable strokes.

---

## **7\. Absence Policy**

When a player is absent, their expected score is estimated conservatively to avoid unfair advantage.

Absent Player Handicap \= the higher of:

1. Posted handicap \+ 2 strokes, or

2. Average of their 3 worst differentials from the last 5 rounds

Capped at \+4 strokes above the posted handicap.

---

## **8\. Course Play Rules**

### **8.1 Breakfast Ball**

* On the first hole only, each player may take one breakfast ball (a free second tee shot).

* If used, the second shot must be played—the player cannot choose between the two.

* The breakfast ball must be declared immediately after the first tee shot.

### **8.2 Lost Ball or Out of Bounds (OB)**

* Option 1: Take a 1-stroke penalty and drop at or near where the ball was lost or went OB, no closer to the hole.

* Option 2 (Optional Retees): The player may re-tee and hit again, lying 3 off the tee (stroke and distance).

* The player must declare their choice immediately after confirming the ball is lost or OB.

### **8.3 Hazards (Penalty Areas)**

A penalty area includes any body of water, creek, drainage ditch, marsh, pond, or other area designated by the committee as difficult or impractical to play from.

There are two types:

* Crossing Hazards (similar to “yellow” areas): The player must drop a new ball on a line between the flagstick and the point where the ball entered the hazard, keeping that point directly between them. The drop may be as far back as desired on that line, with a 1-stroke penalty.

* Lateral Hazards (similar to “red” areas): When a hazard runs alongside the hole and a drop directly behind is not practical, the player may drop within two club lengths of the point where the ball entered the hazard, no closer to the hole, with a 1-stroke penalty.

Clarification:

* The “line of flight” concept is not a rule. Drops must always relate to the point where the ball last entered the hazard, not where it crossed above or beyond it.

### **8.4 Gimmes**

* All putts should be holed out whenever possible.

* A gimme may be offered only if the putt is 2 feet or less.

* No gimmes allowed outside 2 feet.

### **8.5 Lie Improvement (“Fluff Rule”)**

* Players may slightly improve their lie by fluffing the ball with their club head.

* The ball cannot move more than 3 inches and must not change the shot challenge (e.g., cannot move out from behind a tree, bush, or obstruction).

---

## **9\. Integrity & Oversight**

* The “drop two worst” rule minimizes sandbagging (intentional high scoring).

* The committee may review and adjust handicaps if scoring patterns appear inconsistent with a player’s established ability.

* All adjustments will be documented and communicated transparently.

---

## **10\. Weekly Publishing & Transparency**

Each week, the league will publish:

* All players’ last five differentials

* The three used in calculation

* League, Course, and Playing Handicaps

* Any absent-player adjustments

This ensures all players can verify calculations and promotes fairness.
