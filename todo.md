1) Remove "week_number" field from matches documents. It is no longer used.
2) handicaps collection is getting records added, rather than updated when scores are updated. Think through the purpose of this collection. If the intent is to have it a point in time view of a league members handicap, then we should store it in league_members collection. For history over time we _may_ be better off capturing via handicaps applied to matches, soreted by time. Otherwise we'd need some construct to not keep saving the same handicap every time scores get updated.
3) I suspect count of "handicaps" records is being used to determine number of matches played, rather than just looking at number of matches played.  I have one player with a provisional handicap of 11.6. They had a match on a course with rating 34.9 and slope 126. In the current "scores" document for this player, course_handicap is set to 14, playing handicap set to 13, and handicap_index set to 13.7. Since this is the first match week, the handicap_index should be same as provisional, or 11.6, in this case. Course and Playing handicap look too high, as well.  I entered a round originally, but had wrong provisional (had 17.8). I updated provisional handicap, and re-saved scores. This may have triggered a math bug or a score processing defect.
4) Verify stroke allocation math. There should never be a scenario where both players receive strokes in a matchup. I have an instance where one player recieved 3 net strokes, and another player recieved 1 net stroke. This should never happen. The first player should receive 2 net strokes and the other player 0.
